(If you intend to deploy to <code>karthiksubbarm.github.io</code>, then the repo name MUST be that).</li> <li>Choose Public or Private (Public required for free GitHub Pages).</li> <li>DO NOT initialize with a README, license, or .gitignore. Click \"Create repository.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Get the Repository URL:</p> <ul> <li>Click \"Code\". Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL. (I'll assume HTTPS in this example, but SSH is recommended if you've set it up)</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>II. Preparing Your Local MKDocs Project:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Initialize Git:</p> <ul> <li>In your MKDocs project directory, run: <code>git init</code></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Create <code>.gitignore</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a file named <code>.gitignore</code> with this content:</p> <pre><code>site/\nvenv/\n.venv/\n__pycache__/\n*.pyc\n*.log\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Stage, Commit, and Link:</p> <pre><code>git add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/KarthikSubbarm/KasuWorks.git\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>III.
